* When a customer (both RC and VC) tries to make an order, and it returns false (using make_order() from customer_operations.py), that means they don't have enough money as the deposit. 
Hence, if it returns false, write on the window something like "Not enough money in deposit, insert more money." or "Unsuccessful."

* When customers (both RC and VC) login, display the number of warnings they have on the top of the screen (not as a button)
