For the surfer_screen:
-there should be button that says "View top 3 most popular dishes" and another button that says "View top 3 highest dishes." 
-here should be another button that says "View ratings" and another button that says "Apply to be a registered customer."

For the delivery_screen:
there should be a button that says "File complaint" since delivery person can also file complaints about customers


For the chef screen:
-I would add two more buttons that read "View complaints" and "View compliments". For example, say a customer gives a compliment on the dish, "This dish was great!" or 
makes a complaint saying "This dish was not great!" The chef should be able to view these compliments/complaints. 
The "View personal ratings" button is good because say we have a customer and they rate the chef's dish a 5/5, the chef should be able to view that rating.
