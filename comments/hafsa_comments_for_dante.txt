For the surfer_screen:
-Change the name "Guest/Surfer" to "New customer/Surfer"
-There should be button that says "View top 3 most popular dishes" and another button that says "View top 3 highest dishes." 
for 1. on the project requirements doc, it says "For new customers or surfers, the top 3 most popular (ordered most) dishes and top 3 highest rated dishes are listed"
-There here should be another button that says "View ratings" because number 3. on the project requirements doc says "Surfers: who can browse the menus
and ratings"
-Sign up button looks good because it basicslly means the surfer/new customer can sign up to become a registered customer. 




For the chef screen:
-I would add a button that reads "View compliments/complaints." For example, say a customer gives a compliment on the dish, "This dish was great!" or 
makes a complaint saying "This dish was not great!" The chef should be able to view these compliments/complaints
(on the requirements doc, number 4. says this stuff) 
-The "View personal dish ratings" button is good because say we have a customer and they rate the chef's dish a 5/5, the chef should be able to view that rating.


For the delivery_screen:
There should be a button that says "File complaint" since delivery person can also file complaints about customers.
-Similar to the chefs screen, there should be a button that reads " "View compliments/complaints."
For example, say a customer gives a compliment on the DP saying "He or she was nice!" or 
makes a complaint saying "He or she was not nice!" Therefore, the delivery person should be able to view these compliments/complaints.  
(on the requirements doc, number 4. says this stuff)
