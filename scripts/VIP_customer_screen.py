# TODO: Dante, create the screen that a VIP customer would see after logging in (using Tkinter)
# it would be best to start with registered_customer_screen.py first since many of those features are also features of VIP_customer_screen.py

# don't worry about having the screen in sync with the login screen, simply create your own canvas, frame, etc. 
# this screen can stand alone for now and later we can think about how we will sync this with the login screen

# look at page 43 of the Second Phase Report (reports/second_phase_report.pdf)
# the screen should look like the "My Task" box with every feature for VIP customers listed as buttons and having each feature clickable to open a new screen associated with the feature
# look at specifications that professor posted to see what features VIP customers have
# the new screen for each feature can simply say "Hello World" or something relevant for now, but the main goal is having it open to a new screen associated with the feature
